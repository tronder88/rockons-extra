# rockons-extra

3rd party hub for Rocko-ons to Rockstor NAS distro.

Instructions how to install from https://github.com/rockstor/rockon-registry/ which is the original repo for rock-ons

How can I add app from this repo?

If you are familiar with Docker and know how to run apps by hand, you can create a Rock-on for the same with a little bit of craft. There are three broad steps.

Configure the Rock-On service on your Rockstor system. Please see the http://rockstor.com/docs/docker-based-rock-ons/overview.html.

download the rockon you need via wget, winscp etc. to /opt/rockstor/rockons-metastore/[app].json. Hit update in the Web-UI and install your brand new Rock-On!
