# rockons-extra

3rd party hub for Rocko-ons to Rockstor NAS distro.

Instructions how to install from https://github.com/rockstor/rockon-registry/ which is the original repo for rock-ons

How can I add my own app?

If you are familiar with Docker and know how to run apps by hand, you can create a Rock-on for the same with a little bit of craft. There are three broad steps.

Configure the Rock-On service on your Rockstor system. Follow this doc.

Create your Rock-on profile file, [app].json following the clues in this readme.

Upload the file to /opt/rockstor/rockons-metastore/[app].json. Hit update in the Web-UI and install your brand new Rock-On!
